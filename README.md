# testcontainers-oracle

This a is POC to create a test using **testcontainers** with **Oracle DB**. AFAIK the 
documentation on TC page about oracle integration is not updated, so i was a big effort 
create this example.

The creation and population was delegate on TC using a sql script linked on url connection.
